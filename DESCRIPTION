Description: The `BiocIO` package contains high-level abstract classes
    and generics used by developers to build IO funcionality within the
    Bioconductor suite of packages. Implements `import()` and `export()`
    standard generics for importing and exporting biological data formats.
    `import()` supports whole-file as well as chunk-wise iterative import. The
    `import()` interface optionally provides a standard mechanism for
    'lazy' access via `filter()` (on row or element-like components of
    the file resource), `select()` (on column-like components of the
    file resource) and `collect()`. The `import()` interface
    optionally provides transparent access to remote (e.g. via https)
    as well as local access. Developers can register a file extension,
    e.g., `.loom` for dispatch from character-based URIs to specific
    `import()` / `export()` methods based on classes representing file
    types, e.g., `LoomFile()`.
